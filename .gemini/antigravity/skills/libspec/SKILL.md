# Antigravity + Libspec

Your environment is configured to use the **Libspec** MCP server, providing advanced navigation and specification-driven development tools.

## Available Tools

### 🔍 libspec_search
- **Purpose**: Semantic search for specification components (Requirements, Features, Scenarios).
- **Usage**: When you need to understand the "why" behind a piece of code or find where a requirement is implemented.
- **Example**: `libspec_search(query="user authentication")`

### 👁️ libspec_peek
- **Purpose**: Retrieve definitions, docstrings, and type hints for a symbol without reading the entire file.
- **Usage**: Use this for quick orientation before diving into the implementation.
- **Example**: `libspec_peek(file_path="auth.py", line=42, character=10)`

### 🏗️ libspec_symbols
- **Purpose**: List all structural components (classes and methods) in a specific file.
- **Usage**: Orientation in large or unfamiliar source files.
- **Example**: `libspec_symbols(file_path="models.py")`

### 🔗 libspec_usage
- **Purpose**: Find all semantic references to a component across the entire project.
- **Usage**: **Mandatory** before refactoring or deleting shared code to perform impact analysis.
- **Example**: `libspec_usage(file_path="utils.py", line=12, character=5)`

## Dev Workflow
1. **Edit Spec**: Edit/define the requirements/features in the specification files. **Always decompose broad requirements into granular, single-responsibility requirement classes (e.g. `HelpCommandReq`, `SnapshotsCommandReq`) rather than using monolithic requirement blocks to ensure first-class specification footprinting.**
2. **Diff Spec (MANDATORY BEFORE CODING)**: You **must absolutely** run a spec diff using the `uv run libspec diff` command to identify specification drift and review mutations/dependencies before coding begins.
3. **Analyze and Declare Dependencies (Agent-Only)**: Immediately after reviewing the spec diff, you (the coding agent) must analyze the new/modified specification components to determine if any logical dependencies exist between them. If dependencies are identified, you must record them using the `declare_dependency` MCP tool (e.g., `declare_dependency(ref="spec.cli.LinkCommandOnlyOnChangesReq", depends_on="spec.cli.LinkCommand")`) before starting implementation. Do not add dependency boilerplate to the source code; rely entirely on this transactional ledger registration.
4. **Test Driven Development**: Follow best practices in test driven development to write tests for the components.
5. **Implement**: Implement the components to ensure the tests pass.
6. **Commit Spec Database**: Make sure to commit the `.libspec/libspec.jsonl` database log file to Git alongside your code changes. This is extremely important to ensure specification history is synchronized.
7. **Author a git message and present to user**
